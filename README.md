In July 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44938759) there were more than five million people across England who were unable to book an appointment with a GP outside of working hours, when all patients were due to have full extended access by 1 October 2018.

Labour accused the government of "breaking its promises".

NHS England said it was still on target to provide access to extended care for all patients by the 1 October deadline.

Our analysis showed:

- More than 22 million people - or 40% of patients registered with GPs - had "seven-day 8am to 8pm" access to GPs - defined as full provision by NHS England
- Just over half the population had access to partial provision. This is when a GP practice can offer the minimum of ninety minutes of bookable appointments once a week
- Only two areas offered full provision to GPs for all patients
- Some 5.4 million people - or 10% of patients - had no access to GPs outside of normal working hours
